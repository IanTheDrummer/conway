I needed a break, and I've been meaning to make a neat demo for my `terminal
library`_ so I wrote a Game of Life blitter for the terminal. Whee!

.. _terminal library: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/blessings/


Getting it running
==================

::

    pip install blessings

Then download conway.py, and run it::

    python conway.py

Have fun!
